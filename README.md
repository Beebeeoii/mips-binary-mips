# MIPS to Binary to MIPS

This is a simple converter that helps to encode MIPS assembly instructions to binary and also decode binary machine code into MIPS instructions.

I made this as a fun project for my [Computer Organisation](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2100/) module (CS2100) taught by Dr Collin and Aaron :D
